How can an algorithm disrupts the body? Or, how can a brain intervenes an algorithm? The project focuses on brain, body, geometry and algorithm from these two different aspects and questions. Electroencephalogram (EEG) Experiments are encounters of a pair, or a group of people (dancer and non-dancer) mediated by neurosignals. A personâ€™s brain is monitored by EEG, or brain waves, where another person can see, hear the brain waves and react to them based on a choreography, or improvisation. In addition, Generative Pathways are choreographic thinking assisted by a computer, or an algorithm, provides deterministic paths given by a set of rules, such as points, lines and planes based on single and two dimensions. We interpret these pathways allowing our bodies to sink into the geometry. Here, the aim is to create a performance/installation where the research process will be documented to be a part of the piece.
