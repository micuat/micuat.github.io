      ‘The Body and the Other’ is a dance performance - choreographic installation about the multiple body as a
      physical,
      digital and hybrid in-between corporeality placed in a mixed reality topology and time capsule. Through an
      experimental scenography involving video, projection mapping and motion tracking technologies and the use of
      surfaces,
      objects and materials that follow their own technology and potential of movement, the aim is to unfold a
      performance
      as an unpredictable and unprescribed living entity with autonomous choreographic dramaturgy. Thus, the illusion
      about
      the creation of an absolutely pre-designed and fully controlled technological setting is being challenged. By
      revealing what escapes or slips away from technology, ‘The Body and the Other’ invites the elusive real in a piece
      based on an interplay between tactility and emptiness, appearing and disappearing imagery, absence and presence,
      with
      the moving body as a mediator and reminder of the deep human condition.
