      In a darkened room sits a precariously balanced metal plate. Alchemically transformed, light in
      liquid form rests on its surface. Entering the space, you are shadowed by luminescence, and the
      delicate equilibrium is disturbed. Light cascades down the tilted steel sheet creating a waterfall
      of illuminated atoms that find their way onto the floor and across the space. The line that
      separates the physical properties of water and light is blurred in an ever-changing cycle of
      animated play.
    </p>

      Passing Light is an expression at how our engagement with the visible world is shaped by the
      way in which atoms interact. In this instance the behaviour of water is used to transform light
      from a wave into a liquid. Preconceived notions break down, inevitably effecting our
      relationship and interaction with the material world.
